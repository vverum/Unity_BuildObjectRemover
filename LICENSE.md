It will NEVER be allowed to partially/completely sell or rent, the contents of the repository as a standalone product or service (i.e. Asset Store Asset). Meaning, the provided code CAN be included in commercial projects, so long as the contents of the provided source ISN'T part of your selling points. To give some examples:

i. It IS OK to sell an asset or tool that involves AI (i.e.), given how this tool collection didn't provide one, and had to be made from scratch (with the aid of the provided tools).

ii. It will NOT be allowed to sell the module "String Extension" (to give an example), that IS included, as its own standalone product, or as part of the "key features" of an "Extension Collection". This has to be enforced, given you would be attempting to profit off someone elses work (either the original author of the collection, or from those that provided the original code for a given tool).

iii. In the scenario derivative or improved works over other author's code included in this collection, clashes with the license of the original creator, the derived work will still be subject to the rules described here, but the original work will be subject to its own set of provided license rules.
